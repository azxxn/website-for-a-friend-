                <b>I dont know really know how to say this properly but i just want you to know how much you matter to me. You make my days better in the ways i dont even notice and honestly, I cant thank you enough for that. I love just being around you can make things feel lighter and somehow you understand me even when im not great enough at explaining. Every moment with you laughing,talking, or even just silence feels the best to me. You make me feel at home like i can just be myself and i really dont think Ive ever felt that with anyone else. Im grateful for you, for your love, your eyes, the way you care and just for being you. If you ever ask me why do i love you I actually dont have a reason, i love who you are , your existence, your smile, the way you treat me and I believe words are not enough for explaining myself or my love. I didn’t use to believe in love at first sight but then i saw those two beautiful eyes the eyes which I wish my kids get, and I didn’t use to think that brown eyes could be special but then I saw yours and I fell for them so hard I just cant explain. The only thing I want from life is a future with you, just me and you living peacefully in a house together. I really see you as the mother of my kids. I dont always show it but I notice the little things you do more than you realise. There are moments when I catch myself smiling for no reason and it’s just because of you. You are someone I genuinely care about I genuinely love. If someone ever asks me to define happiness I have a one word answer and thats HER . On your birthday i just wanted you to know that youre loved more than I can put into words. Its a small birthday gift from me I wish I could’ve done more but thats all I got for now. I really hope you like this. At last I really love you meri jaan .</b>
